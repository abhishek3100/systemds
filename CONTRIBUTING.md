# Contributing to SystemDS

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to SystemDS!

The following are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

___
### Contribution Guidelines and Standards

Before contributing a pull request for [review](https://github.com/apache/systemds/pulls),
let's make sure the changes are consistent with the guidelines and coding style.

#### General Guidelines and Philosophy for contribution

*   Inclusion of unit tests when contributing new features, will help
    1. prove that the code works correctly, and
    2. guard against future breaking changes.
*   Formatting changes can be handled in a separate PR.
    Example [`bf4ba16b`](https://github.com/apache/systemds/commit/bf4ba16b9aaa9afee20a3f1c03b0ff49c5346a9d)
*   New features (e.g., a new cutting edge machine learning algorithm) typically will
    live in [scripts/staging](./scripts/staging) or its equivalent folder for specific
    feature to get some airtime and sufficient testing before a decision is made regarding
    whether they are to migrated to the top-level.
*   When a new contribution is made to SystemDS, the maintenance burden is (by default)
    transferred to the SystemDS team. The benefit of the contribution is to be compared
    against the cost of maintaining the feature.

#### Code Style

Before contributing a pull request, we highly suggest applying a code formatter to the written code.

We have provided at profile for java located in [Codestyle File ./docs/CodeStyle.eclipse.xml](dev/CodeStyle_eclipse.xml). This can be loaded in most editors e.g.:

- [Eclipse](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10432538/eclipse-import-conf-xml-files#10433986)
- [IntelliJ](https://imagej.net/Eclipse_code_style_profiles_and_IntelliJ)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46030629/need-to-import-eclipse-java-formatter-profile-in-visual-studio-code)

#### License

Including a license at the top of new files helps validate the consistency of license.

Examples:

- [C/C++/cmake/cuda](./src/main/cpp/libmatrixdnn.h#L1-L18)
- [Python](./src/main/python/create_python_dist.py#L1-L21)
- [Java](./src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/api/ConfigurableAPI.java#L1-L18)
- [Bash](./src/main/bash/sparkDML2.sh#L2-L21)
- [XML/HTML](./src/assembly/bin.xml#L2-L19)

## Engineering

> Avoid merge commits. Every commit is a story which makes a history (a linear one!).

### Code authoring and review practices

Let us follow the same guide used by Apache Spark and Google Engineering teams.
see https://google.github.io/eng-practices.

The following sections provide a tailored guide for SystemDS developers.

### ~~It all starts with a Pull Request (PR)~~

~~An effective way to make a change to the project is to make a proposal in
the form of a pull request against the `master` branch. Start with a small changeset
and add `[WIP]` tag to the PR and ask for preliminary review at first to decide upon the
correct direction.~~



### Commit description

> A commit or PR description is a public record of **what** change is being made and **why**.

#### Why the description necessary?

1. To keep a record of the work done.
2. In future, Developers search for the commit based on its description.
3. Future developers, looking for your change because of a faint memory of its relevance.
4. If all necessary information is in the code and not the description, it will be hard to
the commit

Navigate to https://github.com/apache/systemds/commits/master for the descriptions.

Note: PR is also called `commit`, `patch`, `Change List (CL)`, or `Merge Request (MR)`.

#### Structure of the description

##### First Line

1. A summary of what the changeset.
2. A complete sentence, crafted as though it was an order.
    - an imperative sentence
    - Writing the rest of the description as an imperative is optional.
3. Follow by an empty line.

##### Body

It consists of the following.

1. A brief description of the problem solved.
2. Why this is the best approach?.
3. Shortcomings to the approach, if any (important!).

Additional info

4. background information
   - bug/issue/jira numbers
   - benchmark/test results
   - links to design documents
5. Include enough context for
   - reviewers
   - future readers to understand the Changes.

The following is a commit description with all the points mentioned.

[`1abe9cb`](https://github.com/apache/systemds/commit/1abe9cb79d8001992f1c79ba5e638e6b423a1382)

```
[SYSTEMDS-418] Performance improvements lineage reuse probing/spilling

This patch makes some minor performance improvements to the lineage
reuse probing and cache put operations. Specifically, we now avoid
unnecessary lineage hashing and comparisons by using lists instead of
hash maps, move the time computations into the reuse path (to not affect
the code path without lineage reuse), avoid unnecessary branching, and
materialize the score of cache entries to avoid repeated computation
for the log N comparisons per add/remove/constaints operation.

For 100K iterations and ~40 ops per iteration, lineage tracing w/ reuse
improved from 41.9s to 38.8s (pure lineage tracing: 27.9s).
```

#### Good CL descriptions

##### Functionality change

[`1101533`](https://github.com/apache/systemds/commit/1101533fd1b2be4e475a18052dbb4bc930bb05d9)

```
[SYSTEMDS-2603] New hybrid approach for lineage deduplication

This patch makes a major refactoring of the lineage deduplication
framework. This changes the design of tracing all the
distinct paths in a loop-body before the first iteration, to trace
during execution. The number of distinct paths grows exponentially
with the number of control flow statements. Tracing all the paths
in advance can be a huge waste and overhead.

We now trace an iteration during execution. We count the number of
distinct paths before the iterations start, and we stop tracing
once all the paths are traced. Tracing during execution fits
very well with our multi-level reuse infrastructure.

Refer to JIRA for detailed discussions.
```


##### Refactoring

[`e581b5a`](https://github.com/apache/systemds/commit/e581b5a6248b56a70e18ffe6ba699e8142a2d679)

```
[SYSTEMDS-2575] Fix eval function calls (incorrect pinning of inputs)

This patch fixes an issue of indirect eval function calls where wrong
input variable names led to missing pinning of inputs and thus too eager
cleanup of these variables (which causes crashes if the inputs are used
in other operations of the eval call).

The fix is simple. We avoid such inconsistent construction and
invocation of fcall instructions by using a narrower interface and
constructing the materialized names internally in the fcall.
```

##### Small Changeset still needs some context.

Example [`7af2ae0`](https://github.com/apache/systemds/commit/7af2ae04f28ddcb36158719a25a7fa34b22d3266)

Commit message:
```
[MINOR] Update docker images organization

Changes the docker images to use the docker organization systemds
add install dependency for R dbScan
Change the tests to use the new organizations docker images

Closes #1008
```

> Protip: to reference other commits use first 7 letters of the commit SHA-1.
> eg. `1b81d8c` for referencing `1b81d8cb19d8da6d865b7fca5a095dd5fec8d209`

#### Adapt the description before apply to the master

The PRs undergo changes during the review. It can be worthwhile to
review a PR (or commit) description, to ensure it still
reflects what the PR (or commit) does.
